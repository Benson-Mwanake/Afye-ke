      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>AfyaLink KE</strong> is a digital health platform designed to make healthcare more accessible, transparent, 
        and community-driven across Kenya. By bridging the gap between users, Community Health Volunteers (CHVs), and trusted 
        local clinics, AfyaLink KE empowers individuals to take control of their health through technology and information.

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Our mission is to connect Kenyans with reliable medical guidance, starting right from their smartphones. 
        Through our intelligent <strong>AI Symptom Checker</strong>, users can describe their symptoms and receive 
        preliminary insights that help them understand possible causes, urgency levels, and the next steps to take. 
        This tool acts as a digital first line of support—especially useful for those in remote areas or those seeking 
        quick, confidential advice before visiting a facility.

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Beyond virtual assistance, AfyaLink KE works closely with verified clinics and CHVs to ensure users get connected 
        to real people who can help—whether it’s scheduling an appointment, following up on treatment, or finding the nearest 
        healthcare service provider. Each clinic and CHV on our platform goes through a careful verification process to 
        guarantee trust, reliability, and quality of service.
