## Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution

If you notice a problem with the project that you believe needs improvement but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a GitHub issue containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of the code, screenshots, or steps to reproduce the issue if applicable. Project maintainers regularly review issue lists, and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in a clear format.
3. Open a Pull Request against this repository.

A project maintainer will review your change, provide feedback, and approve or comment on it in due course.
